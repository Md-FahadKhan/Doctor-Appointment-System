<h2>All about this Project</h2>
<h4>In a doctor appointment system, there are four types of users: admin, patient, doctor, and regular user. 
Admin manages all the users within the system. Users can make appointments and view the list of available 
doctors. Users can create appointments using their usernames and phone numbers. Each patient is 
identified by a unique ID. When a user makes an appointment, they are placed in the waiting list. Once the 
admin approves the appointment, the user becomes a patient. The admin also has the authority to reject 
appointments. Patient details include their name, email, gender, age, medical issues, and address. Patients 
can access the list of available doctors, as well as view the available medicine list. The system allows patients 
to access their submitted reports. Upon purchasing medicine, patients can view the total bill and print a 
receipt. Doctors are assigned unique IDs and their information includes name, designation, age, department, 
phone number, email, and gender. Doctors can view patient details and reports submitted by the admin. 
They can manage patient lists, write prescriptions, and add medicines to those prescriptions. Each 
prescription is identified by a unique prescription ID. The admin has assigned username and password. 
Admins are responsible for creating, updating, and deleting doctor profiles. They also handle salary 
management for doctors. Patients can purchase medicine from a suggested list provided by the doctor. The 
selected medicines contribute to an automatically calculated total. Patients have the option to print a receipt 
if desired.

<h2>More about this project </h2>

<h4>The Doctor Appointment System introduces an innovative solution to address the diverse 
challenges faced by patients, medical professionals, and administrators throughout the 
appointment coordination process. By harnessing the potential of technology and intuitive 
interfaces, this system stands ready to revolutionize the landscape of healthcare appointment 
scheduling, ultimately leading to heightened patient satisfaction and a more efficient utilization of 
resources. As we continue the current phase of designing the system, our aspirations extend to its 
complete implementation, incorporating a range of additional features. We are resolutely dedicated 
to refining the system based on user input, with a particular focus on enhancing its userfriendliness. Our overarching vision also encompasses the integration of historical patient data 
within the system, enabling seamless patient identification during subsequent visits. Moreover, our 
strategy involves actively updating patients on their treatment progress through notifications sent 
via messages or email.</h4>
